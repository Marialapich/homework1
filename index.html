                A zebra crossing is a type of pedestrian crossing used in many places around the world. Its distinguishing feature is that it gives priority to pedestrians; once someone has indicated their intent to cross by waiting by the crossing, motorists are obliged to stop. These were introduced to the as a road safety measure and were marked by a pair of striped poles, each supporting a flashing orange light. In the 1940s road markings were added to the crossing design: These were alternating dark and light stripes on the road surface. These stripes, resembling the coat of a zebra, give rise to the common. <br>
                The striped road marking has been adopted in many countries for their crossings for this purpose; however not all have the pedestrian priority rule, and not all use the term zebra crossing to describe them. In the UK, the term "zebra crossing" only applies to unsignalled crossings; these have largely been replaced by various types of signalled crossing which restrict the pedestrian's right to cross to particular time slots

                The crossing is characterised by longitudinal stripes on the road, parallel to the flow of the traffic, alternately a light colour and a dark one. The similarity of these markings to those of a zebra give the crossing's name. The light colour is usually white and the dark colour may be painted – in which case black is typical – or left unpainted if the road surface itself is dark. <br>
                Sometimes zebra crossings are placed on a speed bump, meaning the zebra crossing is at level with the pavement. This is done to make it safer for pedestrians to cross, since drivers need to slow down to go over the speed bump. However this is more expensive than a traditional zebra crossing, and can impede the flow of traffic and response times for emergency vehicles, especially on roads with higher speed limits.
